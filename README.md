**Muberza** is a data-intensive project that collects and analyzes statistics related to politicians in Tunisia. It focuses on their online presence and aims to provide insights into their visibility on the web.

### Key Features

- **Monthly Viewer and Reach Graphs:** Explore interactive graphs that calculate the viewership and reach of Tunisian politicians every month.

- **Lifetime Viewer Calculation:** Gain insights into the cumulative viewership of these politicians over time.

## Project Motivation

During the pandemic, Tunisian politicians shifted their political activities to online platforms, particularly Facebook. This transition also witnessed a surge in political tensions, with parties engaging in often uncivil and contentious debates. Many live sessions held on Facebook were marred by personal attacks and ad hominem remarks. The Tunisian public loved this content, and tunred in significant numbers to watch.

### The Role of Data Science

1. Data Gathering: content was scraped from the political battleground of Facebook. 
2. Visual Insights: The heart of our project lies in the visualization of this data. With the help of [ReCharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/), Muberza has informative and engaging data visualizations that bring the numbers to life.
